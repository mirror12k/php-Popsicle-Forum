# Popsicle forum framework
A fully featured forum built on php5.5 and mysql in a MVC style. An expiremental project that I did in a week as practice.

## features:
- forums
- threads by forums
- posts by threads
- user registration and logins
- secure password storage (salted sha256)
- secure CSRF token usage everywhere (none-reusable, securely generated)
- users list
- view posts by user
- keyword search global posts (using mysql FTS)
- class based privileges such as creating forums, threads, posts, etc.
- [un]muting/banning users
- [un]stickying/locking threads
- adminstrative modification of user classes
- pretty urls
- easy database, classes, and admin account setup by just visiting /setup

## etc.
free to use/modify/enjoy. I haven't really worked on the style, a global style.css file is however included everywhere for styling.
